**biicode: A cross-platform C/C++ dependency manager**

biicode provides file-based dependency management for C and C++ languages. Just `#include` what you need
and biicode will download, setup, and build the required libraries.

biicode uses [CMake](https://chocolatey.org/packages/cmake) under the hood, which makes easy adding existing projects to the biicode system, everything 
in a cross-platform way.

Always wanted the power of `pip` or `maven` when dealing with large C/C++ codebases? biicode is the tool for you.

    <releaseNotes>
## 2.8 (7-Apr-2015)

- Better computation of binary targets, if an executable does not depend on its own block library, it will not be linked
- Removed automatic creation of cmake_dummy.cpp to avoid problems with header only libraries
- Removed automatic handling of system deps (math, pthread, winsock), that created problems in new toolchains. Now users directly specify in CMakeLists their libs.
- ADD_BIICODE_TARGETS() has been superseded by ADD_BII_TARGETS(), which will admit a biicode version number, this is done to achieve backwards compatibility while introducing new build behavior.
- Fixed bug of include paths missing in [tests] targets
- Fixed extra verbose message of warning about full path #includes
- Optimized performance of ignore.bii for large number of patterns, that was incredibly slow
- Now published blocks show publisher's user name
- Security fixes
