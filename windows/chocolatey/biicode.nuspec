**biicode: A cross-platform C/C++ dependency manager**

biicode provides file-based dependency management for C and C++ languages. Just `#include` what you need
and biicode will download, setup, and build the required libraries.

biicode uses [CMake](https://chocolatey.org/packages/cmake) under the hood, which makes easy adding existing projects to the biicode system, everything 
in a cross-platform way.

Always wanted the power of `pip` or `maven` when dealing with large C/C++ codebases? biicode is the tool for you.

    <releaseNotes>
## 2.6.1 (11-Mar-2015)

- New [tests] section in biicode.conf. Automatically define your tests, and build and run them with “bii test”
- New simplified alias “bii build”, “bii configure”, “bii test” for “bii cpp:xxx” commands
- New “bii buzz” command. It “bii init -L” + “bii find” + “bii build” for quick getting started for newbies, or after a git clone
- New project layout fixes, the default block at root is named after its biicode.conf [parents] if existing
- Added layout variables to CMakeLists.txt, so cmake can account for variable layouts. Also added CMake variable to indicate a block is a dependency or not.
- Added layout variables to hooks (bii.paths.deps, bii.paths.bin, etc)
- New command options for arduino:settings (–board=uno, –port=auto, etc), so interactive mode can be avoided. Same for rpi:settings
- Automatic handling of PATH, sh.exe is removed from mingw builds, as cmake-mingw builds doesnt work well with it in the path
- Updated supported arduino SDKs to 1.6
- New –hello=c (<stdio>, printf) for pure C projects
- Fixed broken Eclipse project generation
- Fixed changing [requirements] when several blocks are simultaneously opened
- Fixed incorrect warning about bad filenames of files which were in ignore.bii
