**biicode: A cross-platform C/C++ dependency manager**

biicode provides file-based dependency management for C and C++ languages. Just `#include` what you need
and biicode will download, setup, and build the required libraries.

biicode uses [CMake](https://chocolatey.org/packages/cmake) under the hood, which makes easy adding existing projects to the biicode system, everything 
in a cross-platform way.

Always wanted the power of `pip` or `maven` when dealing with large C/C++ codebases? biicode is the tool for you.

    <releaseNotes>
## 2.7 (23-Mar-2015)

- New [tests] section improved, working fine in Visual Studio
- "bii test" now allows parameters (-jN for parallel builds/runs, and CTest other parameters -R -E -C Debug, etc)
- Simpler "policies.bii" configuration, old ones will be automatically migrated
- Now "bii find" works also with [includes], so it is not necessary to fill both the [includes] and the [requirements]
- Search in web for file names with the "file:" label inside the search box
- Issue warning when using absolute #include paths within the current block, as this wouldn't work in simple layouts
- Fixed bug with "bii publish -r" in simple layout
- Renamed custom target "check" associated with "bii test" to "biitest", as the check target might collide with user ones
