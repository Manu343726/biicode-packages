**biicode: A cross-platform C/C++ dependency manager**

biicode provides file-based dependency management for C and C++ languages. Just `#include` what you need
and biicode will download, setup, and build the required libraries.

biicode uses [CMake](https://chocolatey.org/packages/cmake) under the hood, which makes easy adding existing projects to the biicode system, everything 
in a cross-platform way.

Always wanted the power of `pip` or `maven` when dealing with large C/C++ codebases? biicode is the tool for you.
